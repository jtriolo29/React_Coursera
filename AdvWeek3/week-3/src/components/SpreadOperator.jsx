// To clarify, props themselves are immutable in React, but you can certainly override
// them by passing new values or functions. In the case of the LoginButton component,
// it overrides the onClick prop by providing a new function. This is a common practice
// when composing components to customize behavior while reusing props from a parent component.

// So, while the original onClick prop passed to LoginButton from its parent component
// remains unchanged, the LoginButton component creates its own onClick behavior by providing
// a new function when rendering the Button component. This is a valid and common approach in
// React for customizing component behavior while keeping props reusable and relatively unchanged.
