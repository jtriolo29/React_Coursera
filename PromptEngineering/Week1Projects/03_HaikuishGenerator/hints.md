# Build a Haiku Generator in 3 prompts

1. Because a haiku follows a 5-7-5 syllable format, you'll need
to ask ChatGPT to generate three JavaScript arrays, one for each 
line of the haiku.

2. You'd need a function that randomly selects one entry from each
of the three arrays and returns a combined string-- this is 
your haiku!

3. You'll need to prompt ChatGPT to write the HTML and JS for a button
that will trigger your haiku generating function and display it to the 
webpage.
