# Recap: Prompt Engineering 

## Be Specific, Use Technical Terms, and Provide Context

❌ "How do I center something?"
✅ "What's the best way to center a div element horizontally and vertically on a webpage?" 

❌ "Explain reduce"  
✅ Specify language/technology and request examples:
"Explain JavaScript's reduce() method, and include two code examples." 
 
✅ Include additional context like audience and project status: 
"Explain JavaScript's reduce() method to me as if I am a beginning developer just learning how to code. Provide an example of how I can use reduce() to calculate the total price of several items in a shopping cart" 

❌ "How do I create a form?" 
✅ "Please create a form in JavaScript with one input that accepts a string and, on submit, prints that word to the webpage in reverse." 

❌ "Show me an example React component" 
✅ "Please create an example React component that takes in at least one prop and demonstrates how to use hooks like useState and useEffect. The example should not be a typical 'Hello World' example like a counter or a greeting. Assume that I have already set up a React project." 

## Control the Length and formatting of the responses
✅ Ask for steps: "Provide a brief 2-step explanation of creating a custom JavaScript event" 
✅ Info as a table: "Highlight the differences between React and Vue in a tabular format"  
✅ Summarize with bullet points: "Please summarize in 3 bullet points why innerHTML should be avoided" 
✅ Prompt for most important concepts: "List the 5 most important JavaScript concepts a beginning developer should know before learning React."  
✅ Summarize as flow chart: "Use a flowchart to explain how to make a pull request on Github" 
✅ Summarize as pseudo code: "Create pseudo code in the form of code comments describing how I can write a React component that displays the time in a user's local timezone." 
✅ Ask for analogy or metaphor: "Explain the concept of a JavaScript event loop using an analogy" 

## Break tasks into smaller steps  

❌ Avoid very long prompts with many instructions: 

"Help me build a small React application to help users visualize their budget. The application should consist of a form with three inputs: a budget title, a total budget, and current expenditures. When the user submits the form, a progress bar should be added to the page. The progress bar should be green if less than 50% ..."

✅ Break project into subtasks, and subtasks into numbered or bulleted lists:

"Help me build a small React application to help users visualize their budget. Make sure it meets the following requirements: 
1. Include a form component with three inputs: budget title, budget and spent
2. When the form is submitted, add the new budget to an array of budgets" 

## Optimize prompts 
1. Prompt ChatGPT to ask clarifying questions about a broad prompt:

"I'm going to give you a prompt, and I want you to ask me clarifying questions to help me optimize it, then suggest a more effective prompt based on my answers that will yield a more accurate and detailed output. The prompt is: Please give me an example prompt for a React accordion menu." 

2. Answer ChatGPT's clarifying questions. 
3. When ChatGPT returns an optimize prompt, feed the prompt back to ChatGPT
4. Success!

## Role-Base Prompting
✅ Act as a 
... product owner or manager and help me define crucial features for my app / write user stories
... software architect and help me determine which technologies to use for my app
... senior engineer and advise me on best practices 

## Prompt with Examples

✅ "Please write a function to total an array of numbers and return the value as a dollar amount: 

Example input: [5, 40.5, 9, 45, 23, 50]
Example output: $172.50

✅ Please generate some dummy JSON data for music events. Include the following properties: 
- band name
- event date and time
- ticket cost
- venue
- band genre
