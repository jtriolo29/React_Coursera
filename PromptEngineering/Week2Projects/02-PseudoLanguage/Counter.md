Prompt: I want to build my own React component library with common components like form fields, nav bars and accordion menus. 
- Create a pseudo code language similar to Markdown that will help me quickly describe a React component so you can convert it to example code. 
- Respond with a template I can use, as well an example component. Keep the template and the component as simple as possible. 

# ComponentName

State:
- stateVariable: initialValue

Props:
- propName: propType

Render:
- Description of render content

Event Handlers:
- handlerName: Description of handler functionality

# Counter

State:
- count: 0

Props:
- incrementValue: number

Render:
- A button that displays the current count. Each click increases the count by `incrementValue`.

Event Handlers:
- handleIncrement: Increases the count state by `incrementValue`.
